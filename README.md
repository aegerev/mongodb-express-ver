# MongodB: Express Version

## User Story
This project showcases how to connect MongoDB to Express. 

## Deployment
Unfortunately, since we are doing the back-end, I can't deploy it to a website. Sorry about that. :( 

## Instructions to Get the App Working
1. Clone the repository
2. Install expressand mongoose using npm install.
3. Install the MongoDB for VS Code Extension using the VS Code Extension Store
4. In the VS Code console, start up the server by using node index.js (!THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. FAILURE TO DO SO WILL RESULT IN THE APP GIVING AN ERROR.!)
5. Copy the Connection String (from MongoDB) into the box provided in the MongoDB for VS Code.

This is the message it's supposed to print out:
  "Server is running on port 3000"
  "Connected To Database"
